# GUVI_CAPSTONE_PROJECT_Industrial_Copper_Modeling
Predicting a copper prices in the manufacturing industry.

 ##Project Overview
The Industrial Copper Modeling project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting copper prices in the manufacturing industry. The project will focus on addressing data challenges, such as skewness and noisy data, and building regression and classification models to predict continuous variable 'Selling_Price' and binary variable 'Status' (WON or LOST) respectively. Additionally, a user-friendly Streamlit web application will be created to allow users to make predictions on new data.

##Skills Gained from This Project
  Throughout this project, participants will gain proficiency in the following areas:

1. Python scripting for data analysis and machine learning.
2. Data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, outlier detection using IQR or Isolation Forest, and data normalization.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Machine learning modeling for regression and classification tasks using Scikit-learn.
5. Feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
6. Creating an interactive web application using Streamlit to showcase the trained models and make predictions on new data.
7. Maintaining code on GitHub in a modular and maintainable manner.
8. Writing a proper README file to document the project and its execution.
##Problem Statement
The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing, but it may suffer from skewness and noisy data that affects manual predictions' accuracy. The project aims to create machine learning models that can handle these challenges and accurately predict copper prices and lead statuses.

##Data
The dataset contains information on copper prices and various features relevant to the manufacturing industry. The data will be preprocessed, and features will be engineered to train the machine learning models.

Requirements
This project requires the following libraries to be installed:

1. NumPy

2. Pandas

3. Scikit-learn

4. Streamlit
